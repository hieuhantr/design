    <h2> SUMMARY </h2> </div> 
 
 <div class="text">
    AWS is currently using email to send Providers all welcoming information; however, it is lengthy, has low readibility, and low engagement. The solution to this is an information hub that equips Providers with all AWS Activate information, so they can start instructing and promoting to associated startups. <br> <br> In this project, I worked in a team to strategize content, wireframe, and prototype an email post-click landing page.

<div class="text">
    AWS Activate is a free program that works with startups and entrepreneurs to launch, grow, and scale their businesses with AWS. <br> <br> 
In this program, venture capital firms, angel investors, or other startup-enabling organizations are called AWS Activate Provider. After being approved, new Providers will receive an email with a unique Org ID, as well as general benefits and resources to promote to their startups. <br> <br>

<div class="heading">
    <h2> PAIN POINTS </h2> </div> 
 
 <div class="text">
    The welcome email was meant to give Providers all the information so that they can promote the program to their startups. However, this method is not effective for the following reasons: <br> <br> 

    <span> • Length: </span>  Given the complexity and details of the program, the content itself is 11-page long. However, researches show emails are most effective with less than 200 words. <br>
    <span> • Low Readability: </span> Emails are not optimized for modal, tabs, or accordance. With the information displayed mostly in text, the email creates a poor reading experience for users.<br>
   <span> •	Low Engagement: </span> It is inconvenient for Providers to reference the email guide as they work with many startups and points of contact. <br> <br>
    
    As a result, Providers aren’t motivated to promote AWS Activate, and data shows that the email doesn’t move users through the funnel.

<div class="heading">
   <h2> USERS </h2> </div> 

<div class="text">
    AWS Activate Providers are venture capital firms, accelerators, incubators, or other startup-enabling organizations. Specifically, end-users will be C-suite executives, directors, and program managers who work directly with founders. These users value their time, benefits for their startups, and an easy process.<br> <br>
Featured Providers include: <br> <br>

 <div class="heading">
    <h2> PLANNING </h2> </div> 
 
 <div class="text">
    First, our team met with AWS to discuss the program goal, development timeline, and included content. Our goal here is: To create an email post-click landing page that equips Providers with AWS Activate information, so they can start instructing and promoting to associated startups.
 </div>

 <div class="heading">
    <h2> IDEATE </h2> </div> 
 
 <div class="text" style="padding:0;">
    To first get an idea of the content flow and length, we put together some quick wireframes, adhering to AWS's constraints, modules, and design system.
   </div>
   
<div class="heading"></div>    
<div class="columnone" >
        Wireframe V1 <br> <br>
        <img src="project-aws/version-1.png" style="   margin-bottom: 70px;"> </div>
    
<div class="columntwo">
        Wireframe V2 <br> <br>
        <img src="project-aws/version-2.png" style="   margin-bottom: 70px;"> </div>

<div class="heading">
    <h2> CONTENT STRATEGY </h2> </div> 
 
 <div class="text">
    Our initial wireframes followed the content that AWS presented. However, we quickly realized it's not heading in the right direction. With the pain points above in mind, I started readjusting some of the content flow. Specifically, we removed:<br> <br>
    • &#160; <del> The role of an AWS Activate Provider</del>: This section outlines who Providers are and what their role is. However, at this point of the funnel, this information is repetitive and redundant. <br> 
    • &#160; <del >Providers’ benefits</del>: This section outlines how Providers will benefit from this program. However, to best serve the promoting purpose, we replaced this section with the Startups’ benefits. <br> <br>
    
    Given the information density, we proposed creating sub-pages but were declined due to the project resourcing. As an alternative, we added an in-page navigation to aid with readability. <br> <br>
    
    The final content is as follows:<br>
    1.&#160; Welcome section <br>
    2.&#160; In-page navigation <br>
   3.&#160;  AWS Startups benefits<br>
    4.&#160; Activate Portfolio eligibility criteria<br>
    5.&#160; Application process<br>
    6.&#160; Marketing assets & resources<br>
    7.&#160; Frequently asked questions<br>
    8.&#160; Terms & conditions

    <h2> WIREFRAME </h2> </div> 

<div class="columnone">
        <h2> Above the fold </h2> <br>

<div class="columntwo">
        <h2> Below the fold </h2> <br>
        <img src="project-aws/belowthefold.png" style="   margin-bottom: 70px;"> </div>

<div class="heading">
    <h2> COPY ITERATION </h2> </div> 
 
 <div class="text">
    After presenting the wireframe, we also proposed to tweak some copy to best serve our users. <br> <br>

    • &#160; In-page navigation: We decided to remove the section counts (e.g. “Section 1”) to imply an unordered list and place less control on users’ freedom. We also replace each section name (e.g. “Your AWS Activate benefits”) with a more user-friendly language, emphasizing the action users want to take. (e.g. “Understand your Activate benefits”) <br> <br>
    • &#160; Section sub-header: We wanted each sub-header to be very precise; specifically, to be less than six words. An example of the change was going from “Marketing assets, messaging templates & collateral for your startups” to “Resources & assets for your startups”.

    <h2> REFLECTION </h2> </div> 

<div class="text">
    This project went through many delays because of client resourcing and changing content—so late that my internship duration actually ended before the web development was done. However, it was still a great experience as I learned how to design within constraints, propose new ideas to client, and work along content development. <br> <br>
